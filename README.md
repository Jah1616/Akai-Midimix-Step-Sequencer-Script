# Akai-Midimix-Step-Sequencer-Script
This script will turn your Akai Midimix into a step sequencer for FL Studio.

For this script to work, your Midimix will have to be set to the default mapping.
You can achieve this using the Midimix Editor program if you have ever changed your mapping.

SETUP: 
1. Download the .py file:
2. Make a map inside:
      Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\
      and call it "MidiMix"
3. Put the .py file in the map you just created.
4. Go into FL Studio's MIDI settings.
Click on "MIDI Mix"
Click on "Controller type"
Select "AKAI Midimix2 (user)"
